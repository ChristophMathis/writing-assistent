### The Napkin Challenge

David Snowden published the statement that the VSM would never pass the napkin test.
I love this challenge - I think the problem is not inherent part the VSM..

The flexibility in defining the granularity is one of the big advantages of the VSM.
On the other hand, it is both pragmatic and has a solid scientific basis – which is not true for every model. In each step, it has a well-founded heuristic for designing an organization. For example, it is recursive, and the definition of the recursion hierarchy is not part of the system; instead, it is a matter of human judgment.

I will try a test run when I meet my buddies this evening.
1. Design for autonomy
2. Enable and empower horizontal coordination
3. Where this fails, take care of remaining issues and call this management
4. Think about the future and outside stakeholders, especially customers
5. Have a north star to moderate today's operations and tomorrow's challenges

### Talking about the Napkin

#### Arriving in the pub
>I met my friends for our semi-regular meeting in our Stammkneipe. When we meet, it's never boring. Sometimes we complain about world politics, sometimes we celebrate ourselves and can hardly believe how brilliant we are. Sometimes we just make fun of other people who once again haven't got the message. Today, the conversation turns to my new obsession: the Viable System Model


My friends have a few critical questions: Have you found another silver bullet? Why the Viable System Model (VSM) and what can it contribute? Do we really need another model? We've just laboriously digested the last introduction.

I can give the all-clear: no, the VSM is not intended to replace anything. It is compatible with our Lean-based approaches.
It's about the controllability of organizations in a complex environment.


#### First beer: Design for Autonomy
>OK, let's get started. It's easier to talk over a beer, and everything goes more smoothly. Yes, a portion of fries would be good too. And a napkin. Thanks, I have a pen. Let's go.


- a political (strategic) and a functional (tactical) view on autonomy
- the fear of talking about autonomy
- it is just the flip side of empowerment and delegation
- sometimes words have a strange connotation
- autonomy is one of these, people prefer to talk about empowerment ( a word I would never use in German - the “empowerment act” (“Ermächtigungsgesetz”) was the tainted law which gave Hitler the power in Germany in 1933)
- how autonomy is important
- it is the fastest and cheapest way to react to external requirements
- it works if the group (e.g. the dev team) has the competencies to cover all surprises
- how to make a team more autonomous
- filter requirements (e.g. accept only certain jobs or from certain customers)
- remove dependencies (of environments or parallel teams)
- add skill (requisite variety)
- Cohesion: the limit on autonomy
- (Why I prefer cohesion to alignment) Alignment is the mindset side - cohesion is the fact
- There are also dysfunctional ways to limit autonomy: micro management
- What happens if the team cannot handle things on their own? This is where the next item gets to the napkin
#### Second beer: Enable and empower horizontal coordination
The limits of autonomy
>But first I need another beer. These fries make me thirsty, and I shouldn't have eaten them. Tomorrow my scale will scold me again. But it's getting exciting: the demand for autonomy isn't really new, we've found scientific justification for team autonomy—and for the limits of autonomy.

Horizontal coordination is the next best thing when teams cannot act autonomously for various reasons, whether due to shared resources or overlaps in their field of work.

In an organization, this horizontal coordination is the most important lubricant that makes the organization function. These can be formal structures, but also informal ones such as the coffee kitchen (or, in the past, the smoking break).

However, many companies do not understand the enormous potential of these mechanisms. Not utilizing this horizontal communication means missing out on really important opportunities.

Do we really still need management? Stafford Beer, the inventor of VSM, definitely thought so, and that is a difference from, for example, Scrum or sociocracy variants, which do not talk about management at all or want to map management completely through network structures.
Third beer. Where this fails, take care of remaining issues and call this management
>Good question. Now the discussion is starting to unravel, with the old sayings of software developers about importance (none) or possible occupational therapies for managers (leaf blowing) being trotted out again. No, folks, we were just about to talk about cohesion, and your corny jokes aren't really helpful.


- management acts directly only when the rest fails
- this has a practical aspect as well as an emancipatory dimension: encourage people to solve their own problems
- what does “resource bargain” mean
- what is the purpose of corporate intervention
- conflicts which the operative units cannot solve
- cohesion problems
- compliance problems
#### Fourth beer: Think about the future and outside stakeholders, especially customers
>Beer is much easier to digest with beer - wow, I had no idea how bad my jokes could be. Speaking of bad jokes: today we're drinking beer like there's no tomorrow, but I was just about to talk about how to take tomorrow into consideration appropriately.

...

But one thing is clear: there is no true harmony between the hamster wheel and the ivory tower. The exciting question is how to deal with this conflict. This leads to the next point:
#### Fifth beer: Have a north star to moderate today's operations and tomorrow's challenges

>Oh man, this is starting to get really hard work and I have to really concentrate – maybe I should have ordered water after all. No idea how I'll feel tomorrow morning.
I have now neglected exactly what this point is about: long-term and sustainable well-being. In any case, I need a taxi today.

The conflict cannot be resolved because both perspectives, the “inside and now” and the “outside and later,” are legitimate; more than that, both are important.

The internal perspective, focusing on the functioning and effectiveness of the organization, ensures competitiveness and stability. People in these areas tend to criticize others as superfluous, inefficient, or out of touch: “We earn the money and you spend it,” one could summarize.

The outward and forward-looking perspective determines the future security of the company. These people claim that if we don't warn of dangers and identify opportunities, you'll be out of the market the day after tomorrow.

When such a conflict arises between children, the tendency is to send them to different rooms. While this tends not to help in a family, it has far-reaching consequences in a company. I consider the idea of a “dual operating system,” in which the two systems operate separately from each other, to be simply toxic. Nothing creative happens in a company anymore; it has robbed itself of all opportunities to creatively develop its potential.

It is far better to use this tension for creative exchange. This requires several ingredients
- Criteria for moderation: a kind of “North Star,” principles, or values—as different as they may be in each company
- Mechanisms for moderation and balancing interests
- An authority with the necessary power in case of emergency—even if this authority should “almost never” be used, it must exist

This creates a great opportunity, an adaptive space in which the rules of effectiveness and ideas for securing the future contribute to a productive whole.

- the natural conflicts between “inside and now” and “outside and then”
- toxic ‘solutions’: if you let the two work independently of each other (“dual operating system”), the whole thing can become toxic
- a big opportunity: the adaptive space




# additional questions
- Canvas
- Complexity and Cybernetics
- Ashby's Law

I would like to start a round of in-depth discussion – so far, I can only explain what awaits us when we embark on this journey. The Napkin Challenge is the first step: does it contribute anything to the view of decisions and information flows?

What does not really fit on the napkin and is still important
- The Viability Canvas is the next step
Failures and Pitfalls
- why is it not an org chart and not a flow diagram: the third dimension
