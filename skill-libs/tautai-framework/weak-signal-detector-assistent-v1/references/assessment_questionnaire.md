# Organizational Readiness Assessment Questionnaire

## Instructions

This questionnaire assesses your organization's readiness for implementing weak signal detection capabilities. For each statement, rate your organization on a scale of 1-5:

- 1 = Strongly Disagree / Not at all
- 2 = Disagree / Minimal
- 3 = Neutral / Moderate
- 4 = Agree / Substantial
- 5 = Strongly Agree / Exemplary

Be honest in your assessment. The goal is to identify areas for improvement, not to achieve a perfect score.

## Interpretation Guide

**Overall Readiness Percentage**:
- **80-100%**: Excellent foundation for weak signal detection
- **60-79%**: Good readiness with some areas to strengthen
- **40-59%**: Moderate readiness; significant work needed
- **20-39%**: Low readiness; foundational work required
- **0-19%**: Minimal readiness; start with culture building

**Dimension Analysis**:
Focus improvement efforts on dimensions scoring below 60%. Prioritize based on:
1. Lowest-scoring dimensions
2. Cultural factors before structural (culture enables structure)
3. Quick wins to build momentum

**Next Steps**:
1. Review detailed scores to identify specific weaknesses
2. Prioritize 2-3 improvement areas for initial focus
3. Develop action plan using the implementation roadmap in references/cultural_enablers.md
4. Re-assess every 6 months to track progress
