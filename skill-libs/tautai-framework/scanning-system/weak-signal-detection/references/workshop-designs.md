**Culture:** Match formality, pace, and style to norms

**Maturity:** Adjust complexity based on foresight experience level

**Purpose:** Focus activities on most relevant objectives

**Format:** Adapt for virtual, hybrid, or in-person delivery

The key is maintaining the core learning objectives while making the experience relevant and engaging for participants.
