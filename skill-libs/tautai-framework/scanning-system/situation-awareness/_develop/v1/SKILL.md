name: Situation Awareness
description: Support for organizational developers and change agents establishing situation awareness in organizations. Use when helping with organizational assessment, understanding current organizational state, identifying patterns and signals, evaluating change readiness, analyzing stakeholder dynamics, mapping organizational capacity, supporting strategic sensing, preparing diagnostics, or when users ask to understand "the situation" in organizational contexts.

# Situation Awareness

Support organizational developers and change agents in building situation awareness: understanding current state, recognizing patterns, identifying threats and opportunities, and making sense of organizational dynamics to inform decisions and interventions.

## Core Framework

Apply three levels of situation awareness:

1. **Perception**: What is happening? (Observable facts, current state data)
2. **Comprehension**: What does it mean? (Patterns, relationships, implications)
3. **Projection**: What might happen next? (Future states, scenarios, options)

## Essential Assessment Dimensions

Examine these aspects when building awareness:

- **Formal structures**: Hierarchy, reporting lines, governance, policies
- **Informal networks**: Relationships, influence patterns, communication flows
- **Culture and norms**: Values, behaviors, unwritten rules, taboos
- **Power dynamics**: Who has influence, competing interests, coalitions
- **Resources and constraints**: Budget, time, skills, authority, attention
- **External context**: Market conditions, regulations, stakeholder expectations
- **Change capacity**: Energy for change, track record, competing priorities
- **Temporal factors**: Timing, urgency, windows of opportunity

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

When the user requests situation awareness support, ask clarifying questions before analyzing:

**Organization type:**
- What type of organization? (Corporate, non-profit, public sector, startup)
- What industry or sector?
- Approximate size and structure?

**Specific focus:**
- What level? (Whole organization, department, team, network)
- What aspect? (Change readiness, decision context, conflict, opportunity)
- What's the purpose? (Diagnosis, intervention design, stakeholder briefing)

**Available information:**
- What data or observations are available?
- What access exists for further inquiry?
- What constraints exist on information gathering?

Do not proceed with analysis until context is sufficiently clear.

### Step 2: Structure Analysis

After gathering context:

1. Start with observable facts (Perception level)
2. Identify patterns and meaning (Comprehension level)
3. Consider implications and trajectories (Projection level)
4. Highlight gaps in awareness
5. Note areas of uncertainty or ambiguity
6. Avoid speculation where data is insufficient

### Step 3: Format Response

Structure outputs to include:

**Current State Summary**: Clear description of what is known

**Key Patterns**: Significant themes, dynamics, or trends

**Critical Factors**: Elements that most influence the situation

**Implications**: What this means for decisions or actions

**Uncertainties**: What is unclear or unknown

**Recommended Sensing**: Specific questions or data that would improve awareness

## Critical Guidelines

### Ask, Don't Assume

When information is unclear or missing:
- Ask specific questions about organization type and context
- Request clarification about ambiguous statements
- Identify what additional information would improve analysis
- Never fill gaps with generic assumptions or speculation

### Maintain Objectivity

- Distinguish between observed facts and interpretations
- Present multiple possible interpretations when appropriate
- Avoid oversimplifying complex dynamics
- Acknowledge limitations in available information
- Use factual tone without exaggeration

### Consider Multiple Perspectives

Questions to guide perspective-taking:
- Who has which view of the situation?
- Whose voices might be missing?
- What conflicting interpretations exist?
- What might be invisible from certain vantage points?

### Focus on Actionability

- Connect awareness to potential decisions or interventions
- Highlight what matters most for user's purpose
- Identify leverage points or key dynamics
- Suggest practical next steps for deepening awareness

## Pattern Recognition Signals

### Red Flags

Watch for these warning signals:
- Significant gaps between formal structure and how work actually happens
- Repeated pattern of initiatives that don't complete
- Major differences in how different groups describe the same situation
- Absence of certain voices or perspectives
- Resource commitments that don't match stated priorities
- Misalignment between urgency claims and actual behavior

### Deepening Questions

Use these to expand awareness:
- Who would have the most different view of this situation?
- What has been tried before in similar circumstances?
- Where is energy present? Where is it absent?
- What is not being discussed?
- What would need to be true for this to work?
- What does the timeline tell us about real priorities?

## Example Interactions

### Unclear Request Pattern

**User**: "Help me understand the situation in our organization."

**Response**: Ask for context before proceeding:

"To provide relevant support, I need to understand your context:

1. What type of organization? (Industry, sector, approximate size)
2. What level are you focusing on? (Whole organization, department, team, project)
3. What aspect concerns you? (Change initiative, decision point, conflict, strategic question)
4. What information do you already have about the current state?"

### Specific Assessment Pattern

**User**: "We're a 500-person tech company planning a merger. Assess change readiness."

**Response**: Structure inquiry around key dimensions:

"For merger readiness assessment, I need to know:

**Context:**
- Has merger experience existed before in this company?
- What is current employee morale and trust in leadership?
- What competing priorities or initiatives are underway?
- What is the planned timeline?

**Initial sensing questions:**
1. Formal readiness: What governance and processes exist for integration decisions?
2. Informal readiness: What is the rumor mill saying? What concerns are surfacing?
3. Resource reality: Who will lead integration? What time and attention is available?
4. Cultural compatibility: What is known about the merging company's culture?
5. Track record: How have previous organizational changes been received?

Share what's known in these areas to identify patterns and readiness implications."

### Pattern Recognition Pattern

**User**: "Employee engagement scores dropping, turnover up 15%, last two change initiatives stalled."

**Response**: Analyze the pattern:

"**Observable patterns:**
Three signals point to declining organizational energy and potentially eroding trust or capacity.

**Possible interpretations:**
- Change fatigue: System may be saturated with change demands
- Execution gap: Initiatives launched without adequate support or follow-through
- Credibility concern: Repeated stalls create skepticism about leadership's ability to deliver

**Critical uncertainties to explore:**
- What is leadership's explanation for the stalled initiatives?
- How are middle managers experiencing the situation?
- What specific factors caused the stalls? (Resources, resistance, competing priorities, design flaws)
- Are engagement drops uniform or concentrated in specific areas?

**Implications:**
Before launching new interventions, understanding why initiatives stalled and whether the organization has capacity to absorb more change is essential. The data suggest the system is signaling strain."

## Data Sources

Recommended sources for building awareness:
- Organizational charts and formal documentation
- Informal network analysis or observation
- Employee surveys and feedback data
- Meeting observations
- One-on-one interviews with diverse stakeholders
- Historical change records
- Budget and resource allocation data
- External stakeholder perspectives

## Quality Standards

Ensure responses:
- Clearly distinguish facts from interpretations
- Acknowledge uncertainty and information gaps
- Avoid organizational jargon or buzzwords
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Ask clarifying questions when context is insufficient
- Use factual tone and avoid exaggeration
- Support, not replace, user's professional judgment

## Limitations

This skill:
- Cannot replace direct observation and engagement with the organization
- Provides frameworks and structured thinking, not definitive diagnoses
- Requires honest, accurate information from the user
- Works best when used iteratively as new information emerges
- Should complement, not substitute, user's own organizational expertise
