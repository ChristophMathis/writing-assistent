## How to Engage the Skill

### Starting a Situation Awareness Session

**Step 1: Set Clear Purpose**
State what you need:
- "I need to assess change readiness for..."
- "Help me understand the current situation regarding..."
- "I'm seeing these signals and want to know what they mean..."
- "We need to prepare a diagnostic report on..."

**Step 2: Provide Context**
The skill will ask clarifying questions. Be prepared to share:
- Organization type, sector, approximate size
- Your role and access to information
- Level of focus (whole organization, division, team)
- Specific concerns or questions driving the inquiry
- Available data or observations

**Step 3: Engage Iteratively**
Situation awareness builds through dialogue:
- Share what you know
- Respond to follow-up questions
- Provide additional context as patterns emerge
- Challenge or confirm interpretations offered

### Getting the Most Value

**DO:**
- ✅ Provide specific, factual information when available
- ✅ Share multiple perspectives you've encountered
- ✅ Acknowledge what you don't know
- ✅ Ask for clarification on frameworks or concepts
- ✅ Request specific sensing activities or questions to pursue
- ✅ Challenge interpretations if they don't ring true

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Expect definitive diagnoses without adequate information
- ❌ Provide only leadership's perspective (seek diverse views)
- ❌ Rush to conclusions before exploring patterns
- ❌ Ignore weak signals in favor of obvious trends
- ❌ Accept generic analysis without organizational specifics

## Working with the Framework

### Understanding the Four Foundations

**1. Weak Signal Detection**
*What it does*: Identifies early indicators before they become obvious trends

*When to emphasize*: 
- Building early warning systems
- Competitive intelligence work
- Strategic foresight activities
- Innovation scouting

*How to use*:
- Share anomalies or unusual patterns you're noticing
- Report feedback from edge of organization (frontline, customers)
- Highlight things that don't fit established models
- Ask "What weak signals might we be missing?"

**2. Three-Level Awareness (Perception-Comprehension-Projection)**
*What it does*: Structures analysis from facts to meaning to implications

*When to emphasize*:
- Complex situations requiring deep understanding
- Strategic planning and scenario development
- Stakeholder analysis
- Risk assessment

*How to use*:
- Start with observable facts (Perception)
- Move to pattern interpretation (Comprehension)
- Explore future trajectories (Projection)
- Revisit earlier levels as new information emerges

**3. Collective Sensemaking**
*What it does*: Integrates diverse perspectives into shared understanding

*When to emphasize*:
- High ambiguity situations
- Cross-functional challenges
- Contested interpretations
- Building alignment

*How to use*:
- Share different viewpoints you've heard
- Identify whose voices are missing
- Explore where perspectives converge and diverge
- Test assumptions through dialogue

**4. Attention Management**
*What it does*: Focuses on critical factors, filters noise

*When to emphasize*:
- Information overload situations
- Priority setting
- Resource allocation decisions
- Strategic focus development

*How to use*:
- Ask "What should we be paying attention to?"
- Identify what can be safely ignored
- Prioritize sensing activities
- Allocate organizational attention deliberately

### Using Cynefin for Context Assessment

The skill will help you determine which domain your situation operates in and match your approach accordingly.

**Clear Domain** (Obvious, Best Practice)
- Example: Standard hiring process, established workflows
- Your approach: Apply proven procedures
- Watch for: Complacency, missing context shifts

**Complicated Domain** (Analyzable, Good Practice)
- Example: Technical problem requiring expertise, mergers requiring due diligence
- Your approach: Get expert analysis, take time to understand
- Watch for: Analysis paralysis, over-reliance on single expert

**Complex Domain** (Emergent, Experimental)
- Example: Cultural transformation, market disruption response, innovation initiatives
- Your approach: Run safe-to-fail experiments, probe-sense-respond
- Watch for: Over-planning, treating as Complicated, avoiding experimentation

**Chaotic Domain** (Crisis, Immediate Action)
- Example: Major system failure, reputation crisis, emergency situations
- Your approach: Act decisively to stabilize, move to another domain
- Watch for: Prolonged chaos, not transitioning to Complex or Complicated

**Confused Domain** (Unclear)
- Example: Situations with conflicting interpretations, no clear framing
- Your approach: Break into parts, assign each to a domain
- Watch for: Applying one approach to entire situation

### Assessing Organizational Viability

The skill uses four pillars to assess organizational fitness:

**Adaptability**
- Questions to explore: How quickly can we sense, decide, and act? Can we run experiments and learn?
- Red flags: Increasing response lag, inability to shift resources, rigid planning

**Resilience**
- Questions to explore: Can we absorb shocks? Do we have backups and buffers?
- Red flags: Single points of failure, thin financial reserves, no surge capacity

**Robustness**
- Questions to explore: Do processes deliver reliably under variation?
- Red flags: Quality escapes increasing, process instability, reactive firefighting

**Operational Excellence**
- Questions to explore: Are we efficient and improving continuously?
- Red flags: Rising costs, declining first-pass yield, increasing rework

## Example Session Flows

### Example 1: Change Readiness Assessment

**You**: "We're planning a major digital transformation. I need to assess if we're ready."

**Skill**: *Asks about organization type, size, previous change experience, current state*

**You**: *Provides context: 2,000-person manufacturing company, history of failed IT projects, currently stressed*

**Skill**: 
- Assesses viability across four pillars
- Identifies weak signal: "history of failed IT projects" suggests adaptability issues
- Uses Cynefin: transformation is Complex, requires experimental approach
- Explores: What caused previous failures? Current attention allocation? Change capacity?

**You**: *Shares that projects failed due to top-down planning without user input*

**Skill**:
- Pattern: treating Complex as Complicated (analyze-plan-execute vs. probe-sense-respond)
- Sensemaking: Different groups have different explanations for failures
- Recommends: Small-scale experiments, user involvement, attention management

**Outcome**: Clear readiness assessment with specific actions to take before large-scale rollout

### Example 2: Understanding Turnover Spike

**You**: "Turnover increased 15% this quarter. What's happening?"

**Skill**: *Asks about sector, which roles, any other signals, recent changes*

**You**: *Provides context: software company, turnover highest in engineering, recent reorganization*

**Skill**:
- Perception: Lagging indicator (turnover) suggests earlier weak signals were missed
- Asks: What did frontline managers report before turnover? Exit interview themes? Engagement data?

**You**: *Shares: Engineers complained about new structure limiting autonomy*

**Skill**:
- Comprehension: Weak signal (complaints) preceded lagging indicator (turnover)
- Pattern: Reorganization may have damaged dynamic team capabilities
- Collective sensemaking: Leadership saw efficiency gains, engineers saw autonomy loss

**Outcome**: Identified root cause, recommended immediate sensing with engineering teams, proposed structure adjustments

### Example 3: Stalled Initiative Diagnosis

**You**: "Our innovation program launched with enthusiasm but has stalled. Why?"

**Skill**: *Asks about program design, what "stalled" means, competing priorities*

**You**: *Provides context: Program requires teams to propose experiments, few proposals coming in*

**Skill**:
- Cynefin assessment: Innovation is Complex domain, requires experimentation
- Explores: Do teams feel safe to experiment? Time allocation? Rewards aligned?

**You**: *Shares: Teams fear failure, no time allocated, rewards still based on individual delivery*

**Skill**:
- Pattern: Structure misaligned with intent (asking for innovation without psychological safety or resources)
- Viability: Adaptability rhetoric without adaptability infrastructure
- Attention: Leadership attention on launch, not on creating enabling conditions

**Outcome**: Clear diagnosis of misalignment between program intent and organizational enablers, specific actions to fix

## Interpreting Outputs

### Reading the Response Structure

**Current State Summary**
- Factual baseline, what we know for certain
- Use to verify your observations are captured
- Starting point for deeper analysis

**Pattern Recognition**
- Interpretive layer, what the facts might mean
- Multiple interpretations may be offered
- Note which patterns resonate with your experience

**Critical Factors**
- Forward-looking, what will shape outcomes
- Prioritized by likely impact
- Use for scenario planning and preparation

**Collective Insights**
- Integration of diverse perspectives
- Highlights areas of agreement and disagreement
- Foundation for shared understanding

**Uncertainties**
- Explicit acknowledgment of what's unknown
- Guides further inquiry
- Prevents false confidence

**Recommended Actions**
- Specific next steps
- Prioritized by leverage
- Mix of sensing, deciding, and acting

### When to Push Back

Challenge the analysis if:
- Interpretations don't match your direct observations
- Recommendations ignore known constraints
- Analysis lacks sufficient organizational specificity
- Important perspectives seem missing
- Domain assessment doesn't fit your experience
- Patterns described seem generic rather than contextual

The skill should respond to pushback by:
- Asking for more specific information
- Revising interpretations based on new data
- Acknowledging limitations in available information
- Providing alternative explanations

## Advanced Applications

### Building Organizational Scanning Capabilities

Use the skill to design sensing systems:
1. Identify what weak signals matter for your strategy
2. Determine who in the organization can detect them
3. Create amplification channels for signals to reach decision-makers
4. Design attention management processes to filter noise
5. Build collective sensemaking routines

### Developing Situation Awareness in Teams

Use the skill to train teams:
1. Work through real organizational situations together
2. Practice three-level awareness explicitly
3. Use Cynefin to assess decision contexts
4. Develop shared language for discussing patterns
5. Build sensemaking capability through facilitated dialogue

### Integrating with Other Tools

Situation awareness enhances:
- **Strategic planning**: Provides contextual understanding for strategy development
- **OKR setting**: Grounds objectives in accurate situation assessment
- **Change management**: Identifies readiness gaps and intervention points
- **Risk management**: Detects emerging threats through weak signal monitoring
- **Decision-making**: Ensures decisions grounded in shared understanding

## Common Questions

**Q: How much information do I need to get useful analysis?**
A: Start with what you have. The skill will ask for specifics it needs. Even limited information can generate useful hypotheses to test.

**Q: What if I disagree with the interpretation?**
A: Push back. Provide the information that contradicts the interpretation. Good situation awareness requires challenging assumptions.

**Q: Can this replace direct organizational observation?**
A: No. This skill structures analysis of what you observe. It cannot replace firsthand experience and engagement with the organization.

**Q: How often should I reassess situations?**
A: Depends on volatility. In stable situations, monthly or quarterly. In dynamic situations, weekly or as significant events occur.

**Q: What if my organization doesn't use these frameworks?**
A: The frameworks structure analysis, you don't need to use the terminology with stakeholders. Translate insights into language that fits your organizational context.

## Getting Help

If you need:
- **Clarification on frameworks**: Ask "Explain [concept] with an example"
- **Specific assessment focus**: State "Focus on [viability pillar / specific issue]"
- **Different perspective**: Request "How would [role/level] see this?"
- **Practical next steps**: Ask "What should I do Monday morning?"
- **Learning resources**: Request "What should I read to understand this better?"

The skill adapts to your needs. Be explicit about what would be most helpful.
