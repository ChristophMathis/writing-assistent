# Situation Awareness Quick Reference

## Four Foundations (Tautai Scanning System)

1. **Weak Signal Detection**: Identify early, ambiguous change indicators
2. **Three-Level Awareness**: Perception → Comprehension → Projection
3. **Collective Sensemaking**: Multiple perspectives create shared understanding
4. **Attention Management**: Focus on what matters, filter noise

## Three-Level Awareness Framework

| Level | Question | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Perception** | What is happening? | Observable facts, current data |
| **Comprehension** | What does it mean? | Patterns, implications, the "why" |
| **Projection** | What happens next? | Future states, scenarios, responses |

## Cynefin: Match Response to Context

| Domain | Characteristics | Approach | Risk |
|--------|----------------|----------|------|
| **Clear** | Cause-effect obvious | Sense-Categorize-Respond | Complacency |
| **Complicated** | Expert analysis needed | Sense-Analyze-Respond | Paralysis |
| **Complex** | Hindsight only | Probe-Sense-Respond | Over-planning |
| **Chaotic** | No cause-effect | Act-Sense-Respond | Panic |
| **Confused** | Domain unclear | Break into parts | Wrong approach |

## Viability: Four Pillars of Fitness

**Adaptability**: Can you sense, decide, and act quickly?
- Sensing speed
- Decision-making speed
- Experimental learning

**Resilience**: Can you absorb shocks?
- Financial buffers
- Backup systems
- Surge capacity

**Robustness**: Do processes deliver reliably?
- Quality consistency
- Process stability
- Error-proofing

**Operational Excellence**: Are you efficient?
- First-pass yield
- Unit cost
- Continuous improvement

## Essential Inquiry Questions

### Context Gathering
- What type of organization? (Industry, sector, size)
- What level of focus? (Whole, department, team)
- What aspect concerns you? (Change, conflict, decision, opportunity)
- What information is available?

### Pattern Recognition
- Where are weak signals appearing?
- What anomalies don't fit established patterns?
- Which voices are missing?
- What's capturing organizational attention?

### Viability Check
- Which pillar is weakest?
- How fast can this organization respond?
- What would break under 20% worse conditions?

### Domain Assessment
- Is cause-effect obvious (Clear), analyzable (Complicated), or emergent (Complex)?
- What approach does the organization currently use?
- Does the approach match the domain?

### Sensemaking
- What different interpretations exist?
- Where do perspectives converge or diverge?
- What assumptions need testing?

## Red Flags: System Dysfunction

**Structural Issues:**
- Work happens differently than org chart suggests
- Initiatives repeatedly don't complete
- Different groups tell different stories

**Capability Gaps:**
- Response lag increasing
- Single points of failure
- Quality escapes rising
- Initiative fatigue evident

**Attention Problems:**
- Resources don't match stated priorities
- Urgency claims contradict behavior
- Critical issues not discussed

## Response Structure

1. **Current State Summary** (Perception)
   - Observable facts
   - Sensor reports
   - Performance data

2. **Pattern Recognition** (Comprehension)
   - Themes and dynamics
   - Weak signals
   - Cynefin assessment

3. **Critical Factors** (Projection)
   - Future influencers
   - Likely responses
   - Emerging opportunities/threats

4. **Collective Insights**
   - Multiple interpretations
   - Convergence/divergence points
   - Assumptions to test

5. **Uncertainties**
   - Unknown factors
   - Contradictions
   - Domain disputes

6. **Recommended Actions**
   - Sensing activities
   - Experiments to run
   - Decisions to make
   - Attention priorities

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Speculation without data**: Ask for clarification rather than assume
❌ **Single perspective**: Always seek multiple viewpoints
❌ **Domain mismatch**: Treating Complex as Complicated (or vice versa)
❌ **Ignoring weak signals**: Focusing only on lagging indicators
❌ **Individual sensemaking**: Missing collective intelligence benefits
❌ **Attention sprawl**: Monitoring everything instead of prioritizing

## Quick Domain Check

**Is this situation Clear?**
- Everyone agrees on cause-effect
- Best practices exist and work
- Stable, predictable environment
→ Use standard procedures

**Is this situation Complicated?**
- Experts can figure it out
- Analysis reveals answers
- Good practices available
→ Get expert analysis

**Is this situation Complex?**
- Cause-effect only clear in hindsight
- Multiple plausible interpretations
- Emergent, unpredictable
→ Run safe-to-fail experiments

**Is this situation Chaotic?**
- Crisis, no clear patterns
- Immediate threat
- Need stability fast
→ Act decisively to stabilize

## Deepening Your Assessment

**When engagement is low:**
→ Check all four viability pillars
→ Assess change capacity and competing priorities
→ Look for initiative fatigue patterns

**When initiatives stall:**
→ Check domain assumption (treating Complex as Complicated?)
→ Assess execution capability and support
→ Look for attention fragmentation

**When conflict emerges:**
→ Use as sensemaking opportunity
→ Surface diverse perspectives
→ Check for productive vs. destructive conflict

**When strategy seems unclear:**
→ Check identity and purpose alignment
→ Look for strategic coherence gaps
→ Assess leadership sensemaking capability

## Remember

- **Ask, don't assume**: When information is unclear, request clarification
- **Facts before interpretation**: Distinguish observation from meaning
- **Multiple perspectives**: Seek diverse viewpoints
- **Domain matters**: Match approach to context
- **Weak signals matter**: Don't wait for obvious trends
- **Collective is better**: Sensemaking improves with diverse input
- **Viability is fitness**: Track adaptability, resilience, robustness, excellence
