# Weak Signal Detection for Organizational Design

Support organizational designers in establishing robust weak signal detection capabilities by assessing readiness, implementing detection methods, and creating supportive cultural and structural conditions.

## Overview

Weak signals are early, ambiguous indicators of emerging change that may significantly impact an organization's future. Detecting and acting on these signals provides strategic advantage, but requires specific organizational conditions, capabilities, and processes.

This skill supports:
- Assessing organizational and cultural readiness for weak signal detection
- Implementing structured detection and analysis methods
- Building cultural and structural enablers
- Classifying and prioritizing detected signals
- Establishing sustainable scanning processes
- Creating organizational learning systems

## Core Workflow

The weak signal detection capability development follows this sequence:

1. **Assess Readiness**: Evaluate cultural and organizational conditions
2. **Identify Gaps**: Determine what needs strengthening
3. **Design Interventions**: Develop targeted improvement initiatives
4. **Implement Methods**: Establish detection processes and tools
5. **Build Capacity**: Train people and create support systems
6. **Monitor and Refine**: Track effectiveness and continuously improve

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users need to:
- Assess organizational readiness for weak signal detection
- Evaluate cultural conditions (psychological safety, curiosity, openness to challenge)
- Design foresight and horizon scanning processes
- Establish early warning systems for strategic threats
- Build organizational peripheral vision capabilities
- Create signal classification and prioritization frameworks
- Implement strategic intelligence functions
- Develop futures thinking and scenario planning practices
- Connect weak signal detection to strategic planning
- Train teams in signal detection methods

## Step 1: Assess Organizational Readiness

Begin by evaluating the organization's readiness across four dimensions: cultural, structural, cognitive, and resource readiness.

### Using the Assessment Script

Run the readiness assessment script to generate a structured evaluation:

```bash
python scripts/assess_readiness.py
```

The script provides:
- Comprehensive scoring across readiness dimensions
- Maturity level assessment (1-5 scale)
- Prioritized recommendations
- Next steps based on current maturity

### Conducting the Assessment

For structured evaluation, guide the user through the assessment questionnaire in `references/assessment_questionnaire.md`. This covers:

**Cultural Readiness** (5 factors, 25 questions):
- Psychological safety
- Curiosity orientation
- Openness to challenge
- Tolerance for ambiguity
- Learning culture

**Structural Readiness** (5 factors, 25 questions):
- Cross-functional communication
- Information flow
- Decision-making autonomy
- Peripheral vision mechanisms
- Boundary-spanning roles

**Cognitive Readiness** (5 factors, 15 questions):
- Diverse perspectives
- Systems thinking
- Scenario planning capability
- Pattern recognition skills
- Sense-making processes

**Resource Readiness** (5 factors, 15 questions):
- Time allocation
- Dedicated roles
- Technology infrastructure
- Analytical capabilities
- External network access

### Interpreting Results

**Maturity Levels**:
- Level 1 (Initial): Ad-hoc, reactive, no systematic approach
- Level 2 (Developing): Some awareness, informal practices
- Level 3 (Defined): Established processes, inconsistent application
- Level 4 (Managed): Systematic approach, regular practice
- Level 5 (Optimizing): Continuous improvement, integrated culture

**Priority Setting**:
Focus on dimensions scoring below 3.0 (60%). Address cultural factors before structural ones, as culture enables structure.

For detailed understanding of enablers, see `references/cultural_enablers.md`.

## Step 2: Design Improvement Initiatives

Based on assessment results, design targeted interventions to strengthen readiness.

### Cultural Interventions

**For Low Psychological Safety**:
- Leadership training in non-defensive listening
- Anonymous signal submission channels
- Explicit "safe to share" communication from leadership
- Recognition programs for signal sharing
- Regular retrospectives examining what was missed and why

**For Low Curiosity Orientation**:
- Allocate 10-20% time for exploration
- Fund small experiments without predefined outcomes
- Bring diverse external speakers
- Support cross-domain conference attendance
- Reward interesting questions, not just answers

**For Low Openness to Challenge**:
- Institutionalize devil's advocate or red team roles
- Create assumption-challenging sessions
- Pre-mortem exercises on strategic plans
- External advisory boards
- Regular "what changed?" strategy reviews

**For Low Ambiguity Tolerance**:
- Scenario planning workshops
- Practice with provisional decision-making
- Normalize "we don't know yet" language
- Build contingency planning muscles
- Distinguish between inherent and organizational ambiguity

**For Weak Learning Culture**:
- Implement blameless post-mortems
- Document lessons learned systematically
- Create signal retrospectives
- Establish communities of practice
- Share "interesting failures" stories

### Structural Interventions

**For Poor Cross-Functional Communication**:
- Design cross-functional scanning teams
- Establish communities of practice
- Create shared collaboration platforms
- Regular cross-unit forums
- Job rotation programs

**For Weak Information Flow**:
- Multiple information entry points
- Reduce hierarchical filtering
- Skip-level communication channels
- Leadership visibility to periphery
- Signal escalation protocols

**For Limited Decision Autonomy**:
- Clarify decision rights framework
- Delegate based on reversibility
- Resource pools for experiments
- Clear escalation criteria
- Celebrate local initiative

**For Insufficient Peripheral Vision**:
- Designate horizon scanning roles
- Allocate scanning time and budget
- Access to diverse information sources
- External network participation
- Technology for monitoring

**For Missing Boundary Spanners**:
- Create explicit bridging roles
- Legitimize boundary spanning
- Protect from silo pressure
- Platforms for sharing insights
- Rotational assignments

### Signal Classification Framework

**Signal Types**:
- Technological
- Social
- Economic
- Environmental
- Political
- Competitive
- Regulatory
- Consumer

**Signal Strength**:
- Very Weak: Barely perceptible, single source
- Weak: Multiple mentions, still ambiguous
- Emerging: Clear pattern, limited scope
- Moderate: Widespread recognition, clear implications
- Strong: Undeniable trend, immediate action needed

**Time Horizons**:
- Immediate: 0-1 years
- Short-term: 1-3 years
- Medium-term: 3-5 years
- Long-term: 5-10 years
- Very long-term: 10+ years

### Impact Assessment

Evaluate signals across five criteria (score 1-5 each):

1. **Strategic Relevance** (weight: 0.25)
   - Alignment with strategic objectives
   - Connection to core business

2. **Disruptive Potential** (weight: 0.25)
   - Threat to current business model
   - Industry transformation potential

3. **Opportunity Value** (weight: 0.20)
   - Upside if acted upon proactively
   - Competitive advantage potential

4. **Threat Severity** (weight: 0.20)
   - Downside if ignored
   - Irreversibility of consequences

5. **Scope of Impact** (weight: 0.10)
   - Breadth of organizational units affected
   - Stakeholder range

Calculate weighted impact score, then combine with urgency to determine priority.

### Priority Levels and Responses
