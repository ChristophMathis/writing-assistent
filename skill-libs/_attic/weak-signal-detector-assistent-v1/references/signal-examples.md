## Signal Quality Assessment Examples

### High-Quality Signal Example

**Signal:** Employers adopting "Algorithm Transparency Officers"

**What Makes It High Quality:**
- Specific, observable phenomenon (actual job postings)
- Named sources (specific companies)
- Clear emergence (3 companies in 6 months)
- Plausible drivers (AI regulation concerns, employee concerns)
- Verifiable evidence (job descriptions available)
- Novel (not extension of existing roles)
- Multiple interpretations possible (compliance vs. ethics vs. PR)

---

### Medium-Quality Signal Example

**Signal:** Increasing interest in "slow productivity"

**Limitations:**
- Somewhat vague ("interest" is hard to measure)
- Based on book sales and article mentions (popularity not behavior)
- Unclear if translating to practice
- Could be temporary trend
- Needs more concrete evidence

**Improvements:**
- Find specific organizations implementing policies
- Identify measurable behavior changes
- Document actual practice shifts

---

### Low-Quality Signal Example

**Signal:** "People are getting tired of social media"

**Problems:**
- Too general/vague
- No specific evidence
- Anecdotal basis
- Contradicts usage data
- Likely projection of personal views
- Not novel (people have said this for years)

**Not Really a Signal:** More like wishful thinking or personal observation.

## Signals vs. Trends vs. Fads

### Understanding the Differences

**Weak Signal:**
- Early, ambiguous indicator
- Could develop multiple ways
- Requires interpretation
- High uncertainty

**Emerging Trend:**
- Clear directional movement
- Measurable growth
- Multiple indicators
- Strengthening evidence

**Established Trend:**
- Widespread adoption
- Data-backed
- Affecting strategy
- Less uncertainty

**Fad:**
- Rapid uptake
- Shallow adoption
- Short lifecycle
- Limited staying power

### Examples

**Weak Signal Example:**
Some cities experimenting with car-free neighborhoods

**Emerging Trend Example:**
Electric vehicle sales growing 40% year-over-year

**Established Trend Example:**
Remote work as standard option for knowledge workers

**Fad Example:**
Clubhouse app's rapid rise and fall

## Using These Examples

**For Training:**
- Discuss what makes each a weak signal
- Practice categorizing signals
- Develop assessment criteria
- Build evaluation skills

**For Inspiration:**
- Spark ideas for scanning domains
- Identify relevant sources
- Understand signal characteristics
- Generate hypotheses

**For Calibration:**
- Compare your signals to these
- Check quality levels
- Refine capture process
- Improve documentation

**Remember:** Signals are contextual. What's weak for one organization might be strong for another based on position, industry, and strategy. The key is developing organizational muscle for detection, interpretation, and response.
