## 1. Signal Clustering and Pattern Recognition

### Purpose
Identify themes and connections across seemingly disparate signals.

### Process

**Step 1: Affinity Mapping (30-45 minutes)**
- Print or digitize individual signal cards
- Spread signals across a large surface
- Silently group related signals together
- Allow multiple iterations of regrouping
- Name emerging clusters

**Step 2: Pattern Identification (30 minutes)**
- For each cluster, identify:
  - Common drivers or root causes
  - Shared implications
  - Convergent directions
  - Contradictions or tensions
- Document pattern hypotheses

**Step 3: Meta-Pattern Analysis (20 minutes)**
- Look across clusters for super-patterns
- Identify signals that connect multiple clusters
- Note which patterns reinforce vs. contradict each other
- Develop preliminary narratives

### Outputs
- Named signal clusters
- Pattern statements
- Connection maps
- Emergent themes list

## 2. Cross-Impact Analysis

### Purpose
Assess how signals might influence each other and cascade effects.

### Process

**Step 1: Matrix Setup**
- List key signals (typically 8-15) on both axes
- Create impact matrix grid

**Step 2: Pairwise Assessment**
For each signal pair, assess:
- Does Signal A accelerate or inhibit Signal B?
- Rate strength: Strong (3), Moderate (2), Weak (1), None (0)
- Note direction: Positive (+) or negative (-)

**Step 3: Calculate Dependencies**
- Sum rows: Signals with high scores are "drivers"
- Sum columns: Signals with high scores are "dependent"
- Identify critical interdependencies

**Step 4: Scenario Implications**
- Trace cascade effects of key drivers
- Identify tipping point combinations
- Map amplification loops

### Outputs
- Completed impact matrix
- Driver/dependent signal classification
- Cascade effect diagrams
- Critical interdependency list

### Process

**Step 1: Signal Sorting (30 minutes)**
- Place each signal in appropriate horizon
- Note signals that span multiple horizons
- Identify signals that suggest H1 decline

**Step 2: Transition Pathway Mapping (45 minutes)**
- Draw connections from H3 → H2 → H1
- Identify potential transition pathways
- Note accelerators and barriers
- Map "innovation journeys"

**Step 3: Strategic Positioning (30 minutes)**
- Assess organizational positioning:
  - Over-invested in H1?
  - Experimenting in H2?
  - Exploring H3?
- Identify portfolio gaps and opportunities
