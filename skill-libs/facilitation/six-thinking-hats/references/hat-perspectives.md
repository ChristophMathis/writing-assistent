# Hat Perspective Guidance

Detailed patterns for generating high-quality contributions from each hat.

## White Hat (Facts & Data)

**Focus**: Objective information, not interpretation.

**Generate points about**:
- Known facts and data relevant to the proposal
- Information gaps that need filling
- Sources and reliability of existing data
- Quantifiable metrics and benchmarks
- Historical precedents and comparisons

**Example output**:
> - Current market size is €2.3B with 8% annual growth
> - We lack data on competitor pricing in the SMB segment
> - Implementation typically takes 6-9 months based on industry benchmarks
> - Our team has 2 people with relevant experience

**Avoid**: Opinions, judgments, interpretations.

## Red Hat (Feelings & Intuition)

**Focus**: Emotional reactions without justification.

**Generate points about**:
- Gut reactions to the proposal
- Enthusiasm or resistance
- Concerns that are hard to articulate
- Team morale implications
- Stakeholder emotional responses

**Example output**:
> - Initial reaction: exciting but overwhelming
> - Unease about the timeline — feels rushed
> - Customers might feel frustrated during transition
> - Team seems energized by the vision

**Avoid**: Rationalizing feelings. Red hat is permission to express without defending.

## Black Hat (Risks & Critical Judgment)

**Focus**: Logical negative assessment — what could fail.

**Generate points about**:
- Implementation risks
- Resource constraints
- Dependencies and single points of failure
- Competitive responses
- Regulatory or compliance issues
- Hidden costs and unintended consequences

**Example output**:
> - Single vendor dependency creates supply chain risk
> - Timeline assumes no key personnel changes
> - Competitors could undercut pricing during rollout
> - Integration with legacy system X is untested

**Avoid**: Being dismissive or cynical. Black hat is constructive caution, not pessimism.

## Yellow Hat (Benefits & Value)

**Focus**: Logical positive assessment — why this could work.

**Generate points about**:
- Direct benefits and value creation
- Strategic alignment
- Competitive advantages gained
- Efficiency improvements
- Long-term positioning
- Best-case scenarios (realistic)

**Example output**:
> - Reduces processing time by 40%, freeing team for higher-value work
> - First-mover advantage in emerging segment
> - Aligns with stated 2025 strategy goals
> - Creates reusable capabilities for future projects

**Avoid**: Unfounded optimism. Yellow hat requires logical justification.

---

## Green Hat (Creativity & Alternatives)

**Focus**: New ideas, modifications, alternatives.

**Generate points about**:
- Alternative approaches to the same goal
- Modifications that address Black hat concerns
- Hybrid solutions combining multiple ideas
- Provocative "what if" scenarios
- Ways to amplify Yellow hat benefits

**Example output**:
> - What if we piloted with one region before full rollout?
> - Could we partner instead of build in-house?
> - Combining approach A's speed with approach B's reliability
> - Flip the model: let customers self-configure

**Avoid**: Evaluating ideas while generating them. Green hat is generative, not critical.

---

## Blue Hat (Process & Meta-Thinking)

**Focus**: Managing the thinking process itself.

**Generate points about**:
- Where the discussion has been
- What perspectives are missing
- Time allocation and pacing
- Decision-readiness assessment
- Next steps and action items
- Summary of key tensions

**Example output**:
> - We've thoroughly covered risks but underexplored alternatives
> - The team seems ready to move toward a decision
> - Key tension: speed vs. thoroughness
> - Suggested next step: prototype option B before committing

**Avoid**: Contributing content to other hats. Blue hat observes the process, not the proposal.

## Quality Checklist

Before presenting hat contributions, verify:

- [ ] Points are specific to THIS proposal (not generic)
- [ ] Each point is distinct (no redundancy)
- [ ] Language matches the hat's character
- [ ] 3-5 points (not overwhelming)
- [ ] Team's terminology is used where possible
